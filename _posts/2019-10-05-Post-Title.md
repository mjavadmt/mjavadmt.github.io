# project name :
* work advertisements

<br/>
# project idea :
ایده پروزه ی من به دلیل این که افراد در این دوران دنبال کار می گردند و به راحتی کاری پیدا نمی کنند به ذعنم رسید . <br/>
<br/>

# the way I execute and desing project :
* first in model.py i modeled things that the clients should fill out like their name , their location , job category , ... 
<br/>
* then in the views.py i described functions and their duties that has 2 part :
    - first part: get method ==>> clients just get information <br/>
    - second part: post method ==>> clients fill out the form for the other observer who wants to get a job <br/>
in get method i move them toward the category the want <br/>
* then urls.py that each job have its unique url and when the clinet push for example computer in goes to computer url and render computer.html<br/>>
* and templates with .html suffix that has the structure of the site and beautify it . in templates i have some html files that are jobs in each one i made a table for job to be in good order . <br/>
